# WAT

Different kubernetes charts.

- Hopefully using the current standards
- If possible, uses the official docker images

## What it is not

Please do  consider the helm charts are **not** build to be a starter for you to understand how to install an application the first time. 
Please use the docs of the particular application, learn the Docker environment variables, possible configuration values and all those things.
Please always use the official docs, I will not answer non-chart related questions here.

So it is not a 'how to learn to run rundeck' kind of project. Thank you for respecting that :)
