# WAT

Different kubernetes charts.

- Hopefully using the current standards
- If possible, use the official docker images

## What it is not

Please do not consider the helm charts to be an starter for you to understand how to install a application the first time. Please use the docs of the particular application, learn the Docker
environmenet variables, possible configuration values and all those things. Please always use the
official docs, i will not answer non-chart related questions here.

So it is not a 'how to learn to run rundeck' kind of project. Thank you for respecting that :)
